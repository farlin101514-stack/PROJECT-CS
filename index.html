    <h2>Why worry about Youth Mental Health?</h2>
    <p>Among the many problems in the Philippines, mental health remains as one of the most rampant and is still being solved to this day. Throughout the years, youth mental health has been brought attention, but has not seen much improvement from previous years. Even with people speaking up and bringing awareness on issues of mental health, much is still needed to be done to solve or, at least, relieve the Nation's Youth with a major problem in their development like mental health. But the question remains, Why should we worry about it? </p>
    <p>Mental health isn't less important than physical health, it is just as important as physical health! The Philippines has been struggling with mental health as an ongoing problem yet to be relieved. A study was conducted by University of the Philippines Population Institute (UPPI) during the year 2021, it showed that in the year 2013 —3% or 574,000 Filipino youth tried on ending their life. In 2021, that percentage rose to 7.5% to almost 1 million youth.(Pinoy Youth in Worse Mental Shape Today, Nationwide Survey Indicates, 2022). The Philippines, in general, confronts major challenges in mental health made worse by circumstances like poverty, natural disasters, and inequalities. An estimate of 11.3% to 11.6% of the country's population is affected by mental health disorders, which means that 12.5 millions of people ache with differnet mental health conditions.(Nd, 2024). Furthermore, one in seven adolescents aged 10-19 years old experience a mental disorder. Consequences of not addressing problems like this can go on until adulthood, negatively affecting oppurtunities, and physical and mental health.(World Health Organization: WHO, 2024). Among the many factors that help mental health become such a big problem in Filipino society are underinvestment, lack of mental health professionals, and underdeveloped community mental health services.(Lally et al., 2019).</p>

    <h2>What is being done about it?</h2>
    <p>The Philippines has not abandoned those affected by mental health disorders, but aims to protect the rights of individuals with mental health conditions, and help provide better mental health services with the Mental Health Act of 2018. Since the release of this act, the Philippines has taken a big step in creating a nation with better accomodations for people with mental disorders by enhancing mental health services and quality medicine with 362 access sites all over the country giving out 30 medicines for mental health serving 120,000 people in 2022. With steps like these, Filipino citizens affected by mental disorders will finally be able to embark on a path with a space for them in society.</p>
